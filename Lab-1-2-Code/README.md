### Lab NÂ° 1.2 - Azure Cognitive Services

1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` in the relevant Programmcode with your actual subscription key (aka API-Key) - i.e. `subscription_key = "jsdkas212321....ssdaskhddh"`
   You can get your trial keys from [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) or from your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Assign the actual Azure region in the relevant Programmcode where your cognitive service is running within - i.e. `azureRegion = "westcentralus"`

   You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
   subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
   East US, replace "westcentralus" with "eastus".

   Free trial subscription keys are generated in the "westcentralus" region.
   If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
   this region.
